## Technologies

- Isar, is a fast, lightweight, pure-dart embedded database for Flutter and Dart. It is an alternative to SQLite and Moor. Isar is built on top of Hive and uses the same binary format as Hive. Isar is a NoSQL database and uses indexes to query data.

- AutoRoute, is a declarative routing solution, where everything needed for navigation is automatically generated for you. It's a Dart code generator library that aims to remove all the boilerplate routing-related code from your project.

- qr_code_utils, is a Dart package that provides a set of utility functions to detect and read QR codes from images.
